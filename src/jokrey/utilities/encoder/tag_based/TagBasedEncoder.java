/**
 * Allows for a simple data to be encoded using tags.
 * Nesting this allows for infinitely complex storage structures.
 *      Nesting is achieved by letting complex classes encode their raw data using this utility class
 *         (good practise is to implement EncodableAsString interface and provide a constructor that takes an encoded String)
 * Accessing the data can be done over tags. If a String doesn't exist, the method(getEntry) will return null.
 * When switching around between versions this has to be caught, but if handled right, the remaining data is not lost.
 * The resulting string can then be stored without much effort.
 *
 * One may ask how the overhead compared to Length-Indicator based string encoding(LIse) is justified.
 *       (Since both cannot be altered externally)
 *   The answer lies in the much more declarative code.
 *   When reading from this system each time one has to exactly specify what one wants to read.
 *   Additionally the order or reading(decoding) does not matter anymore.
 *
 * NOTE: This is ENCODING, NOT ENCRYPTING
 *    Though the results of this method may at times be hard to read for any human, should the data be sensitive, then encryption is naturally still required.
 *    For an EncryptedEncoder use the {@link jokrey.utilities.encoder.tag_based.additional.functionality.wrapper.delegation.encryption) package
 *
 * NOTE:
 *    Every function in this interface expect not null parameters.
 *    Except where otherwise specified it also returns non null values(except for getEntry and deleteEntry)
 *    Failure to comply results in either a NullPointerException or worse(though less likely) undefined behaviour
 *
 * @param <String> is the tag format. Should typically be a String, but may also be a ImString or anything else.
 * @param <SF> is the storage format the concrete Encoder uses in it's most raw form.
 *            The end user of the API should never see it.
